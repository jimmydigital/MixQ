long_description = """MixQ  
Your personal local music queue controller for macOS  

MixQ turns your Mac into a powerful, private radio-style DJ station using your existing Apple Music library.  

Load any playlist, rearrange tracks, randomize, remove songs, or skip ahead—all without interrupting the currently playing track. The browser-based interface gives you full control over the queue while respecting the Music app's native playback state.  

Key features:  
• Non-interruptive queue management — load, edit, or shuffle playlists without stopping what's playing  
• Accurate start time estimates with seconds precision and timezone support  
• Dark mode toggle for comfortable late-night sessions  
• Persists your queue across reloads  
• Simple playback controls (play/pause, next, previous)  
• Clean, responsive design that feels like a native macOS utility  

Perfect for:  
- Building the perfect background mix for work, study, or parties  
- Taking full control over what plays next in your library  
- Anyone who wants a lightweight, local alternative to streaming queue managers  

100% private — no cloud, no tracking, no accounts. Runs entirely on your Mac using your local music files.  

MixQ: Queue your vibe, your way. 🎧
